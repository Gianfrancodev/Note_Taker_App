# Note_Taker_App

## User Story

AS A small business owner

I WANT to be able to write and save notes

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Description

I wanted to create an application that can be used to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. I wanted this application to use an Express.js back-end and wanted it to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. I wanted the app to feature a landing page with a link that would take the user to a notes page and when a user clicks the link they are then presented with a page with existing notes plus an empty field to enter a new note. I wanted the the app to feature a 'save note' button, a 'new note' button and a 'clear form' button so a user is able to create multiple notes for multiple tasks quickly and easily. Overall this app is very dynamic and interactive as the buttons appear or disappear depending on the stage of your note taking. During this project, I learned how Express.js can be used effectively for routing. 

## Installation

To install this application and get the development enviroment up and running:

1. Fork and clone the code from the repository provided in the GitHub link.
2. Open the file in your code editor.
3. In the terminal, run the command `npm i` to install the dependencies needed.
4. To invoke the application and start the local server use the command `node server.js`.

To use this application open up the terminal and run the command `node server.js` to start the server running on localhost:3001. Click on "Get Started" to open up the notes page. Click on "New Note" to create a new note. Click on "Save Note" to save the new note or click on "Clear Form" to clear in the input fields. The users note will be saved and displayed on the left side of the browser. Saved notes can be selected and deleted.
